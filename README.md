# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to classify the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.
## Project overview

A Twitter Sentiment Analysis project using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model would involve preprocessing the tweets data to extract features, such as removing stop words, stemming, and converting words to numerical representations. The processed data would then be fed into the LSTM model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. The LSTM model would then classify the tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on the trained weights.

## Scenario

By analyzing text data, we can find meaningful insights from non-numeric data that can help us achieve our objective. With the help of NLP and its concepts,we can do it.Twitter is one of the biggest platforms that people use to write their messages, express their feelings abouta particular topic,and share knowledge in the form of text. By analyzing text data,we can make good decisionsfor different use cases like judging the sentiment of the human tweets, and any product review/comments can tell us the performance of a product in the market.NLP allowsus to study and understandthe colinearity of the data. So we can predict our objective.
## Objective

Useing Python libraries such as Pandas for data operations, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization and EDA tasks,NLTK to extract and analyze the information,Sklearn for model building and performance visualization, to predict our different categories of peopleâ€™s mindsets
## Dataset description

The data contain information about many Tweets in the form of text and their types,as mentioned below

- Tweets: Data is in the form of a sentence written by individuals.

- category:  Numeric(0: Neutral, -1: Negative, 1: Positive)(It is our dependent variable)

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Tensorflow or Keras
- NLTK (for natural language processing tasks such as stop word removal and stemming etc)
## Steps involved in model building

### `1. Data Preprocessing`
- Cleaning and prepping the tweets for analysis, including removal of stop words, stemming, and converting words to numerical representations

### `2. Model Building`
- Implementing an LSTM model using a deep learning library such as Keras and Tensorflow
- Training the model on the preprocessed data
- Fine-tuning the model using techniques such as dropout, regularization, or early stopping

### `3. Model Evaluation`
- Testing the model on a separate text
- Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Twitter Sentiment Analysis project using an LSTM model is a valuable tool for analyzing the sentiment of tweets in real-time. The model uses deep learning techniques to capture the underlying patterns in the text data and classify the tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The project includes important steps such as data preprocessing, model building, and model evaluation, which are crucial for achieving accurate results. To further improve the performance of the model, it is recommended to train it on a larger and diverse dataset and fine-tune it using various techniques. Overall, the LSTM model has the potential to provide valuable insights into the public sentiment on various topics and help organizations and individuals make informed decisions.
